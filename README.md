Why TikTok Follower Growth Matters?
Getting more followers on TikTok isn‚Äôt just about numbers ‚Äì it‚Äôs about building a stronger presence on the platform. Whether you want to boost visibility, engagement, or sales, growing your followers can lead to long-term benefits, such as:

Reach more viewers: TikTok has two main feeds: the For You Page (FYP) and the Following feed. While the FYP is controlled by TikTok‚Äôs algorithm, the Following feed only shows videos from accounts users follow. This means the more followers you have, the more feeds your videos appear in, boosting your visibility.
Increase selling chances: More followers mean more eyes on your products. This can help turn your followers into paying customers over time.
Build credibility: A higher follower count acts as social proof, showing other TikTok users that your brand is trustworthy and popular. This encourages new viewers more likely to trust and follow you.
Boost chances of going viral: When followers watch, like, comment, or share your posts, it signals the TikTok algorithm that your content is valuable, increasing its chances of being shown to more viewers.
Open monetization opportunities: A larger follower base attracts collaboration offers, sponsorships, and partnerships with other brands, opening doors for additional revenue streams.
In short, the more followers you have, the better your opportunities for growth on TikTok. Now that you know why follower growth is important, let‚Äôs dive into the best tips to gain more TikTok followers!

How to Get More Followers on TikTok: 18 Fast & Effective Ways
There are plenty of tips to gain more followers. Here are the best 18 tips on how to get more followers on TikTok:

1. Identify your target audience
To get more followers on TikTok, start by knowing who you‚Äôre creating content for. TikTok has users of all ages and interests, from Gen Z to Baby Boomers, from day-in-life activities to how-to-become-million lessons. So understanding your target audience helps you make content they‚Äôll love. For example, if you run a cooking channel, your audience might prefer quick 5-minute recipes, gourmet dishes, or budget-friendly meals.

Identify your target audience
Here are a few ways to better identify your target audience:

Review your customer persona. This will remind you of their likes and dislikes.
Use TikTok analytics to clearly understand the age, interests, and location of your followers. This, once again, helps you define what they would like to see. 
Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment. TikTok is a rapidly developing platform. You might need to test different video styles to discover what truly resonates with your audience.
The more you tailor your content to your audience‚Äôs preferences, the more likely they are to follow and engage. Always ask, ‚ÄúWould my audience love this?‚Äù and adjust your strategy based on what works.

2. Create follow-worthy content
Content is king. Creating content that‚Äôs worth following is the most important step in this guide on how to get more followers on TikTok. No matter how the platform evolves, good content is what keeps viewers coming back for more or even helps your videos go viral on TikTok.

Great content isn‚Äôt just follow-worthy; it‚Äôs share-worthy, too. When your current followers share your videos with others, it expands your reach and introduces your account to new potential followers.

So, what makes good content? Here are some tips to make greater TikTok videos:

Make it hook: Start with a strong hook to capture viewers‚Äô attention within the first few seconds. If users can‚Äôt tell what your video is about immediately, they‚Äôre likely to scroll past.
Make it fresh: Novel and creative ideas always stand out. Especially, TikTok is a platform that thrives on new trends and unique spins.
Make it entertaining: Can your content make people laugh or feel good? For example, a funny voiceover on a relatable situation can quickly capture attention.
Make it educational: Share quick tips, tutorials, or little-known facts that add value to viewers. A 30-second cooking video showing a simple recipe can engage food lovers and leave them wanting more.
Make it inspiring: Motivate your audience with uplifting messages or ideas. For example, a fitness journey or a Pilates routine, like Madeline‚Äôs video, can inspire others to take action.

Great videos lead to more TikTok followers ‚Äì so keep learning and improving. Studying successful creators in your niche, storing inspiration, and adapting ideas to your unique style are helpful habits.

3. Jump on TikTok trends
Joining in trends is one of the smartest ways to increase TikTok followers. Trends are a huge deal on TikTok. By jumping into these trends‚Äîwhether through challenges, sounds, or creative twists ‚Äì you can boost your chances of landing on the For You page (FYP). This is TikTok‚Äôs main feed powered by its recommendation algorithm, and it‚Äôs where your video can go viral and reach more followers.

Here are 2 main ways to look for the latest trends on TikTok and get more followers:

Use the Search Button: The magnifying glass icon is your go-to tool for finding the latest trends. Tap on it to explore a curated list of trending topics, popular hashtags, and the most-searched content. This feature gives you a quick snapshot of what‚Äôs currently buzzing on TikTok. You can also type specific keywords to uncover trends tailored to your interests or niche.
Watch TikTok Content: Spending time scrolling through TikTok is one of the best ways to spot trends. Pay attention to videos by other creators to identify recurring themes, challenges, or trending sounds. This approach not only helps you find trends but also sparks ideas for how to make them work for your content.

However, keep in mind that trends fade fast, so act quickly and jump in while they‚Äôre still hot. Moreover, not every trend will align with your brand or interests, and that‚Äôs okay. The key is to adapt trends to fit naturally with your brand or style.

4. Use trending songs and sounds
Use popular songs and sounds
If you want to know how to get more likes and followers on TikTok, adding trending sounds to your TikTok videos is a great method. It can help capture people‚Äôs attention immediately. Certain music extracts, songs, and random sound bites get reused frequently for similar content and can boost how well your video does.

Here‚Äôs an example from James and Jasmin, a dancing duo who created their own choreography using the trending song APT by Ros√© and Bruno Mars.


Familiar audio can make viewers more likely to watch your video fully since they recognize the track. Paying close attention to popular audio trends on the platform is important for attracting early interest in your clips.

5. Use the right hashtags
Find the trending hashtags
As with other social platforms, using the right hashtags helps people discover your TikTok content more easily. However, only include hashtags that truly match your video topic. Adding all trending tags just looks spammy.

So, how to gain followers on TikTok by using the right hashtags? When writing captions, you should:

Start typing hashtag phrases to see view counts for tags related to your content. This helps identify suitable hashtags to use.
Be sure to include popular hashtags like #fyp or #foryou, which many creators use, hoping to reach more people via the main FYP feed. While the exact effects of these hashtags aren‚Äôt confirmed, their widespread use still broadens your potential reach.
Some of the best TikTok hashtags you can include in your next TikTok videos are #learnonTikTok, #TikTokviral #foryourpage, and #TikTokTrend. And there are so many more.

6. Post at the right time
Discovering the optimal posting times on TikTok
Timing does matter when you find answers for how to get more followers on TikTok. Discovering the optimal posting times on TikTok greatly influences the reach of your videos. You can find the best time for posting by navigating to your business or creator tools and exploring TikTok analytics.

In the Followers tab, find the Follower activity section. This section provides insights into the peak days and times when your followers are most active. You can then aim to schedule your posts just before these peak times to maximize your posts‚Äô visibility and impact.

Maintaining a record of your content‚Äôs publication times enables you to experiment with various posting schedules. This testing allows you to identify the most effective posting times tailored to your brand‚Äôs audience and engagement.

7. Share content frequently
Post videos on TikTok 1-4 times a day
If your first post is very popular and many people see it, they may visit your page. But what if they see no other videos on your profile? They will leave without following you.

Hence, initially, try to post lots of good quality content as fast as possible. This way, when people visit your page after a popular video, they will see more videos. The extra videos will make them more likely to follow you and stay on your page. This is how to get more followers on TikTok.

If possible, you should aim to post at least a few times every day. This will keep people engaged with your content and encourage them to follow you. 

8. Collaborate with other TikTok creators

How to grow your TikTok account? Your answer could be influencer marketing! 

Influencer marketing isn‚Äôt just effective on Instagram; it seamlessly extends to TikTok as well. Given the abundance of ‚ÄúTikTok-famous‚Äù users, collaborating with influencers presents an excellent opportunity to promote your business.

However, not all partnerships hold the same value. You might wonder how to get more followers and likes on TikTok by collaborating with influencers or creators. Our advice is to find those who align with your target audience and brand values is crucial. Conduct thorough research, assessing their engagement rates, and approach them with a well-articulated proposal. Here are some key dos and don‚Äôts for successful collaborations:

Do:

Establish a clear agreement regarding the content and messaging for the collaboration.
Acknowledge and credit the contributions made by collaborators.
Don‚Äôt:

Engage in collaborations with individuals whose brand contradicts yours.
Compel a collaboration; it should feel genuine and authentic to both parties involved.
9. Explore TikTok duets and stitching
Duet video
If you want to learn how to get more TikTok followers, one of the best ways to do this is to engage with other videos with stitch/duet features.

Stitching: This lets you make a new video that attaches to the end of someone else‚Äôs video. You can record yourself adding more to their clip, like commenting or reacting.
Dueting: When you Duet, your video plays alongside another user‚Äôs video on a split screen. You see both videos at once. Dueting is for making a response video or adding related content that can be watched with the original video.
Notes: Be sure to do stitch or duet videos that are hyper-relevant to your brand.

10. Write closed captions for accessibility
Closed caption text
When it comes to how to get more TikTok followers, it‚Äôs crucial to prioritize social media accessibility in your strategy, encompassing elements like alt text for images and captions for videos. And for TikTok, adding captions is notably straightforward. You have the option to enable automatic captions (or subtitles) (ensuring they are accurately edited) or even incorporate your custom closed caption text overlay.

Numerous brands utilize a combination of both approaches. They employ text overlays to offer extra context while simultaneously allowing closed captions that accurately depict what the person in the video is saying. This dual approach ensures comprehensive accessibility and additional context for viewers.

11. Create a content series

A video series can keep TikTok users involved by continuing a story over multiple clips. This works well if previous videos in the series performed well.

However, you can get even more interactive. If a single funny video garnered lots of positive comments asking for more, deliver by directly replying to those comments with additional sequel videos. 

This links all the parts together in the comment thread. Viewers will see each new installment posted as a reply, pulling them further into actively following the developing storyline. You can also put all the videos in a playlist your TikTok followers can easily follow.

12. Add CTAs to your videos
Write closed caption on the video
If you need more easy ways how to get more followers on TikTok,  including calls-to-action (CTAs) in your videos can encourage followers. Try adding a text overlay near the end with a simple request. This could invite viewers to check out your profile, watch similar videos, or follow your account. An example is an overlay saying, ‚ÄúFollow for more!‚Äù

While every video with a CTA may annoy loyal fans, occasional CTAs aren‚Äôt disruptive. The best uses are in multi-part video series. A ‚ÄúFollow for part 2!‚Äù sticker prompts engagement and helps you get more followers on TikTok by hyping future content. It fosters curiosity and gives an incentive to follow up.

13. Optimize your TikTok profile
Your TikTok profile should clearly explain what your content is about and why users should follow you. Focus on optimizing these two key areas:

Your Bio: With only 80 characters available, make every word count. Highlight your niche and unique selling points, and include a clear call-to-action (CTA).
Your Name: This is the first thing viewers see on their For You Page (FYP), making it your first opportunity to encourage them to follow you. Remember, your name (not username) is what appears on the FYP.
For example, on my small business TikTok account, I‚Äôve included product descriptions, unique features, and a compelling CTA in my bio. My name is crafted to catch attention and communicate my niche directly on users‚Äô feeds, ensuring my profile stands out and aligns with my content strategy.

14. Interact with the TikTok users
Reply by posting a video
Studies indicate that, in contrast to other platforms, a significant 73% of users on TikTok develop stronger connections with brands they actively engage with. The operative term here is ‚Äúinteract.‚Äù

Consistent posting undoubtedly holds significance, yet engaging with your audience is equally important. Engaging actively like comments, likes, or replies to your audience will be the answer to how to get more followers on TikTok. Consider these tips:

Cultivate a devoted fan base that consistently interacts with and shares your videos. 
Enhance a sense of community and the likelihood of others engaging with your content, particularly as your account gains popularity 
Earn favor with TikTok‚Äôs algorithm, potentially expanding your content‚Äôs reach to a wider audience.
15. Promote across various platforms
Most popular social media platform in 2023
Creating good content takes time, so you should share it in multiple places to reach more people. Other platforms that feature short videos, like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, are good options to cross-promote your TikTok videos.

Each social network attracts its own audience demographics. By posting on multiple sites, you expose your video to a wider range of audiences potentially interested in your content. This is how to get more followers on TikTok.

Maximizing the exposure of your video in this manner can introduce your content and profile to new potential followers across different networks. It makes the most of your creative output without requiring extra production work.
